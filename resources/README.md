# iOS Hints and Resources

Please refer to [this Training Kit module](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ios2/module/recEEqjQwd10wS6Wl/) for references to custom drawing.

To create your grid for drawing, use a UIView subclass and the `draw` method.

Hint: Open the Color Picker Xcode guided project for this module to get hints about how to create a grid of squares (these will be white or black). Ask an iOS instructor for the completed guided project if you don't have it.

The app needs to be comprised of 2 screens:

* A main screen with the custom view for the simulation, buttons to play/pause the simulation, run the simulation 1 generation at a time, and a stop button that resets the simulation to a new random field of alive/dead squares.
    * The preset buttons are part of a stretch goal and may be omitted.

* An about screen, triggered however you wish, that lists the rules of the game, and a textview containing information about what learned from researching and implementing the game.
